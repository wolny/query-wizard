                1. we want our suggestions to be based on the past queries created by users;

                types; the value provided to the user is less keystrokes and intelligent suggestions of popular or

            <p>Extract interesting terms and phrases given just a single (brand/product) name</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                A single term is usually the only information we have at the beginning of the Brand Wizard, the question
                is how can we use this single term and our massive solr index of mentions and extract as much as
                possible from this single term or phrase?

                    <li>Build the text corpus</li>
                    <li>Extract (TF-IDF scored) terms using <font color="#f08"><b>MoreLikeThis</b></font></li>
                </ol>
                <aside class="notes">
                    This is one of the approach: when the user enters a brand/product name (or choose our suggestion),
                    we want to treat is as a very simple query, execute it against our index and build the text corpus
                    based on the query results.
                    <br>
                    Then we use this corpus to extract interesting terms, by leveraging some of the
                    Solr core features, namely tf-idf scoring and MoreLikeThis

                    It is possible to tell Solr to index not only terms but also phrases. For this we use so called
                    *Shingles*.
                    A shingle is just a word-based n-gram, as opposed to character-based n-gram we've seen before. <br>
                    Again important thing to note here is the new type that uses the Shingle filter as well as the fact
                    that we store *termVectors*. This might be quite heavy for a large indexes where documents are big, but
                    in case of *test search* it's not that bad.

                    <br>
                    We use those shingles to create "pseudo-phrases" during the indexing process. And since the shingle
                    ends up being a single token in the index,
                    it is a subject to the normal TF-IDF scoring that is used in Lucene. So we will get all the
                    scoring goodies that come from Lucene for free.

                1.1 Lots of user generated data, like queries, rules and categories. We can extract a lot of knowledge
                from it. Use the wisdom of our users to help new users. <br>
                1.2 Nowadays it's all about users behaviour and personalized recommendations. If you look at the query
                expansion problem again it's also a recommendation problem.
                These days it's not only about being able to understand the content itself, it's also having a deeper
                understanding of what our users are doing with that content.
                It's about learning from how the users behave and if many users
                did something clever, our responsibility is to show this cleverness to other users, especially
                to users which are new to the system. There is a term called *reflected intelligence*: how can I learn
                from users behaviour and then reflect it back up to new users.
